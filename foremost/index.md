 ### foremost
 
  Foremost is a forensic program to recover lost files based on
  their headers, footers, and internal data structures.
   
  Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd,
  Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and
  footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use
  command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in
  types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing
  for a more reliable and faster recovery.
 
 **Installed size:** `101 KB`
